I'm visiting the [MHUG](https://mhug.disi.unitn.it/) group at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en) this week. I will be working there for the next 2.5 months on multi-modal interpretability, supervised by [Dr.Massimiliano Mancini](https://mancinimassimiliano.github.io/) and [Dr. Elisa Ricci](https://eliricci.eu/).
