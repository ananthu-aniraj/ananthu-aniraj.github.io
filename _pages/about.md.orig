<<<<<<< HEAD I am a PhD researcher at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en), France, under the supervision of [Dr. Diego Marcos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IUqydU0AAAAJ), in association with the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/). My research specializes in Interpretable-by-Design computer vision systems for fine-grained species classification. I am also co-supervised by [Dr. Cassio Fraga Dantas](https://cassiofragadantas.github.io/) and [Dr. Dino Ienco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C8zfH3kAAAAJ). More information about my research group can be found [here](https://team.inria.fr/evergreen/). I hold an M.Sc. in Embedded Systems from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/) and a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with distinction from the [University of Kerala](https://www.keralauniversity.ac.in/). Before pursuing my PhD, I worked as a Computer Vision and Machine Learning R&D Engineer. I gained valuable experience as an intern at the R&D department of [Lely](https://www.lely.com/en/), where I was mentored by [Dr. Yan Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yan-li-49a60253). Following my internship, I continued working full-time at Lely, contributing to innovative computer vision solutions for dairy farms. My projects broadly aimed at the development of machine learning algorithms for automated health monitoring of cows using multi-camera setups, as well as adapting semantic segmentation algorithms for visual scene understanding in custom farm environments. I am passionate about developing AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable. I believe that interpretability is key to building trust in AI systems. I am also committed to using AI to solve real-world problems and am a strong advocate for reproducible research. ======= Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself.
