My research focuses on building inherently interpretable computer vision systems, with a particular emphasis on fine-grained species classification. I am co-supervised by [Dr. Cassio Fraga Dantas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YgcZQpgAAAAJ) and [Dr. Dino Ienco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C8zfH3kAAAAJ) from the [Evergreen](https://team.inria.fr/evergreen/) team at Inria, and collaborate closely with [Dr. Massimiliano Mancini](https://mancinimassimiliano.github.io/) and [Dr. Elisa Ricci](https://eliricci.eu/) from the [MHUG](https://mhug.disi.unitn.it/) group at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en).

I hold a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with distinction from the [University of Kerala](https://www.keralauniversity.ac.in/) and an M.Sc. in Embedded Systems from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/) in the Netherlands.
