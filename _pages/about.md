I am a PhD researcher at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en), France, working under the supervision of [Dr. Diego Marcos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IUqydU0AAAAJ), in collaboration with the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/). Currently, I am visiting the [MUHG](https://mhug.disi.unitn.it/) group at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), where I am supervised by [Dr. Massimiliano Mancini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bqTPA8kAAAAJ) and [Dr. Elisa Ricci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xf1T870AAAAJ). My research focuses on creating Interpretable-by-Design computer vision systems, specifically for fine-grained species classification. I am also co-supervised by [Dr. Cassio Fraga Dantas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YgcZQpgAAAAJ) and [Dr. Dino Ienco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C8zfH3kAAAAJ).
