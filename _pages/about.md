I am a PhD researcher at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en), France, under the supervision of [Dr. Diego Marcos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IUqydU0AAAAJ), in association with the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/). My research specializes in Explainable/Interpretable-by-Design computer vision systems for fine-grained species classification. I am also co-supervised by [Dr. Cassio Fraga Dantas](https://cassiofragadantas.github.io/) and [Dr. Dino Ienco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C8zfH3kAAAAJ). More information about my research group can be found [here](https://team.inria.fr/evergreen/).

I hold an M.Sc. in Embedded Systems from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/) and a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with distinction from the [University of Kerala](https://www.keralauniversity.ac.in/).

Previously, I worked as a Computer Vision and Machine Learning R&D Engineer and, prior to that, as an intern at the R&D department of [Lely](https://www.lely.com/en/). At Lely, I researched and developed innovative computer vision solutions for dairy farms. This included projects on visual scene understanding for self-driving vehicles and machine learning algorithms for automated health monitoring of cows by tracking their movement patterns across multiple barn cameras.

I am passionate about developing AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable and explainable. I believe that interpretability is key to building trust in AI systems. I am also committed to using AI to solve real-world problems and am a strong advocate for reproducible research.
