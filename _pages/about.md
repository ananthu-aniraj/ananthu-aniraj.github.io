I am a PhD researcher at Inria, France under the supervision of [Dr. Diego Marcos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IUqydU0AAAAJ) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/) in association with the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/), specializing in Explainable/Interpretable-by-Design computer vision systems for fine-grained species classification. I am also co-supervised by [Dr. Cassio Fraga Dantas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YgcZQpgAAAAJ) and [Dr. Dino Ienco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C8zfH3kAAAAJ). I hold an M.Sc. in Embedded Systems from [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/) and a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with distinction from [University of Kerala](https://www.keralauniversity.ac.in/).

Previously, I was a Computer Vision and Machine Learning R&D Engineer and, prior to that, an intern at the R&D department of [Lely](https://www.lely.com/en/). I researched and developed novel computer vision solutions for dairy farms, including dynamic obstacle avoidance systems for self-driving vehicles and algorithms for automated health monitoring of cows by tracking their movement patterns across multiple barn cameras. Some of my work at Lely is now available as published international patents.

I am passionate about developing AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable and explainable. In this way, I believe that we can build trust in AI systems and perhaps even understand how to improve them. I am also interested in the use of AI for solving real-world problems. I am a strong advocate for open science and reproducible research.
